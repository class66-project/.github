# Class66 Project

This github org serves as a central repository for all things related to a 7 1/4" scale Class 66 locomotive.

This is a project to not only create the physical locomotive, but also pack some intelligence and microcontrollers
into the build to allow advanced telemetry and safety features to be added.
